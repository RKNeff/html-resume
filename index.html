                    <p><b>National Airway System Area Specialist</b><br />
                    I am a National Airway System Area Specialist (NAS) for the Federal Aviation Administration at the Anchorage,
                    Alaska Air Route Traffic Control Center. The basic duties of a NAS is to monitor all FAA equipment in the state
                    of Alaska and when something breaks, it is my job to inform the appropriate technical team to initiate repairs. It
                    also includes negotiating release of equipment from the Air Traffic Controllers so that technicians may do periodic 
                    maintenance to insure the integrity of the National Airway System.

                    <p><b>Electronics Technician - Instructor</b><br />
                    As an Electronics Technician - Instructor at the FAA Academy, it was my duty to create, present, and revise curriculum used
                    for the instruction of new hire and seasoned FAA Airway Transportation Systems Specialists (ATSS). During my tenure at the 
                    FAA Academy, I was assigned to the task of course coordinator for a small number of classes. As a course coordinator 
                    it was my job to become a subject matter expert in what was taught in my courses. I was also in charge of making sure 
                    that contract instructors could answer any questions that came up. If they could not answer, I would provide the appropriate
                    answers.
                    I was also part of a technology refresh for the division I worked in. We actively moved the division and then the entire academy
                    to a paperless format. This move saved the FAA over a million dollars per year and our division received awards and recognition
                    for the transition.
                    I was also a curriculum developer for the highly successful new hire common principles course. It was my job to develop coursework
                    and labs in basic electronics, computer networkiing, and UNIX/LINUX for new hires.
