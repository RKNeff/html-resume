                <h4>Photography</h4>
                <p>
                    This hobby has been in the works since I was a child. One of the reasons I'm learning web development is to share 
                    my photography on the internet, maybe sell some if it's good enough. I know there ar platforms to do this, but I like 
                    to take on projects. <a href="./photography.html">Click here</a> to preview some of my works.

                <h4>Electronics</h4>
                <p>Probably the most natural hobby for me considering that I am an electronics technician by trade.
                    As an electronics hobbyist, I have spent a lot of time creating and making electronics devices
                    to help my family, myself, or just to prove to myself that I can do it.  
                    Some of my past builds have been:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Arduino based GPS Speedometer for a bobber (motorcycle) that I restored</li>
                        <li>Electronic circuit to turn LED light on or off remotely through a computer network</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.instructables.com/Childrens-Sleep-Training-Clock/">Sleep Training</a> clock to help my children learn to sleep past 5:00 AM</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br />
                    Some of my current projects include:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Weather Observing station with remote digital display that also reports to <a href="http://www.wunderground.com">Wunderground.com</a></li>
                        <li>Automating the greenhouse that I built last summer.</li>
                        <li>Wiring new LED pods onto side by side ATV.</li>
                    </ol>

                <h4>Outdoors</h4>
                <p>
                    Living in Alaska, it would be hard to avoid anything to do with the outdoors. I enjoy spending time outside 
                    with my family. That can be as simple as playing soccer with my daughter in my backyard or as complex as a
                    multiday backpacking and hiking trek in the backcountry.  I have solo canoed, rafted, and kayaked down many 
                    rivers in Alaska.
                </p>

                <h4>Gardening</h4>
                <p>
                    There are many hobbies that lead to being outside more and one of the most beneficial that I enjoy is gardening.
                    My backyard is slowly being transformed into a beautiful garden space where my family and I grow fruits and vegetables.
                    This hobby has led to building a greenhouse to grow a few things that we don't normally grow in Alaska
                    like tomatoes and peppers of all sorts.

                <h4>Hunting</h4>
                <p4>
                    I spend a good amount of time every year planning and outfitting for hunting in Alaska and every now and then outside of
                    the state too. I am not a sport hunter, and work hard to use as much of the animal that I can to feed my family. Once again,
                    anything to get me outdoors.
                </p4>

                <h4>Fishing</h4>
                <p>
                    As an Alaskan, fishing is an almost sacred hobby. I enjoy it in all it's forms and have never found myself not enjoying fishing.
                    My family and many friends would be happy to let you know that I live by the motto that the worst day of fishing is still better
                    than the best day at work. I enjoy keeping my families freezers stocked with salmon, halibut, cod, trout, and whatever other local
                    species I can fish for.

                <h4>Travel</h4>
                <p>
                    Alaska is a beautiful state. Probably one of the prettiest places in the world. My family and I enjoy exploring this scenic and majestic 
                    place. However, Alaskan winters can be very cold and brutal. So we try to get out of state now and then to escape the cold of winter.
                    I enjoy traveling to places with warm beaches as often as I can. I have visited most of the caribbean, been to Mexico many times, and
                    spend a lot of time in Maui. Now that I am a father, I enjoy it even more with my kids.

                <h4>Skiing</h4>
                <p>
                    Many years ago, I started cross country skiing for fitness reasons. Over the last couple of winters, I have started to learn downhill 
                    skiing as my children learn. I have found that, while I am still new at it, I enjoy it and it gives me a hobby to look forward to in winter.

                <h4>Wine/Mead Making</h4>
                <p>
                    My newest hobby on this list. I have made a total of one batch of Alaskan Blueberry wine and I am currently planning a batch of mead. I enjoy 
                    the process and hope to continue exploring this hobby for years to come.
